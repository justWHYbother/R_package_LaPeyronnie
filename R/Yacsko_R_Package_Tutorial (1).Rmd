```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation

(Here we add the libraries used in this package)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

(If you need to install packages not previously used in class, ex: genomics)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("vcfr")
```

(Now, we install our own R package)

```{r}
#devtools::install_github("natyac/R_Package_Yacsko")
```

(Final part- downloading data for our R package)

```{r}
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BiologicalDataAnalysis2019/2021/main/projects/project_one/data/FossilAnts.csv", destfile = "Ants.csv")
#click the file "Ants.csv" and hit import data
Ants <- read_csv("/cloud/project/R/Ants.csv")
View(Ants)
```

(Now we start the actual tutorial)

## Working example

+ An example of each function and how it works
+ Say something about why this is a good thing to do
+ Say something about expected output
(Do this for each function)

(Ex:)

```{r}
library(project)
TypesOfAnts<- avg(Ants,Genus)
view(TypesOfAnts)
#We used this function because we wanted to see how many different genera were represented in the Fossil Ant records from the experiment/data frame
#So we expected a list of every genera to be in one column, and a count of ever time a genera was listed in original Ants data frame's "Genus" column.
NAbegone<- ByeByeNA("/cloud/project/Data/Ants.csv")
view(NAbegone)
#This function was used so we could regenerate the original Ants but have free of all NA and None values
#this function should have outputted a new data frame free of NA-like values
AntGraph<-AntHistory(Ants,min_ma)
# We wanted a graph to show us the era based on the minimum age when each ant was alive and what era had the most ants living in it.
# the expected output was a histogram that grouped each ant by minimum age with a count of each ant/era

```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r TypesOfAnts}


summary(TypesOfAnts)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r AntGraph, echo=FALSE}
plot(AntGraph)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
